this is a number guessing game coded with python!
how to play:
  1. select a number range and choose whether you want hints or not.
  2. try to guess the number.
    a. if you get the number wrong, it will tell you if the number to guess is higher or lower (if you agreed to getting hints).
    b. if you get the number right, it will ask if you want to play again. say yes or no.
that's it!
star if you like the game :D
